                      <p>Pets are more than just animals—they’re family. And just like any family member, their health is a top priority. One of the most overlooked aspects of pet health is dental care. Many pet owners assume that bad breath or yellow teeth are just part of a pet’s life, but poor oral hygiene can lead to serious health issues, including heart disease and infections.  </p>  <p>With veterinary costs rising and pet insurance becoming increasingly popular, a common question arises: <strong>Does Nationwide Pet Insurance cover dental care?</strong> The short answer is yes—but with some important nuances. Let’s dive deeper into what’s covered, what’s not, and why dental care for pets is more critical than ever.  </p>  <h2>The Growing Importance of Pet Dental Health</h2>  <h3>Why Dental Care Matters for Pets</h3>  <p>Just like humans, pets can suffer from gum disease, tooth decay, and oral infections. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), <strong>80% of dogs and 70% of cats show signs of dental disease by age three</strong>. Left untreated, these issues can lead to:  </p>  <ul> <li><strong>Pain and discomfort</strong> (pets often hide pain, making it hard to detect)  </li> <li><strong>Organ damage</strong> (bacteria from the mouth can spread to the heart, liver, and kidneys)  </li> <li><strong>Expensive emergency treatments</strong> (extractions and surgeries can cost thousands)  </li> </ul>  <h3>The Rising Cost of Veterinary Care</h3>  <p>Inflation isn’t just affecting human healthcare—vet bills are skyrocketing too. A routine dental cleaning can cost <strong>$300–$800</strong>, while extractions or surgeries can exceed <strong>$1,500</strong>. For many pet owners, insurance is becoming a financial lifeline.  </p>  <h2>What Does Nationwide Pet Insurance Cover?</h2>  <p>Nationwide is one of the few providers offering <strong>comprehensive dental coverage</strong>, but policies vary. Here’s what you need to know.  </p>  <h3>Routine Dental Care</h3>  <p>Nationwide’s <strong>Whole Pet with Wellness</strong> plan includes coverage for:  </p>  <ul> <li><strong>Annual dental cleanings</strong> (under the wellness benefit)  </li> <li><strong>Oral exams</strong>  </li> <li><strong>Preventive treatments</strong> like fluoride applications  </li> </ul>  <p>However, this is an <strong>add-on</strong> to their standard accident-and-illness policy, meaning you’ll pay extra for wellness coverage.  </p>  <h3>Dental Treatments for Illness or Injury</h3>  <p>Nationwide’s standard <strong>Major Medical</strong> plan covers dental procedures <strong>only if they’re medically necessary</strong>, such as:  </p>  <ul> <li><strong>Tooth extractions</strong> (due to disease or trauma)  </li> <li><strong>Treatment for periodontal disease</strong>  </li> <li><strong>Oral surgeries</strong> (e.g., fractured jaw repair)  </li> </ul>  <p><strong>Cosmetic procedures</strong> (like teeth whitening) are <strong>not covered</strong>.  </p>  <h3>Exclusions to Watch Out For</h3>  <p>Even with coverage, some dental issues may not be included:  </p>  <ul> <li><strong>Pre-existing conditions</strong> (if your pet had dental disease before enrollment)  </li> <li><strong>Preventive care</strong> (unless you have the wellness add-on)  </li> <li><strong>Non-essential procedures</strong> (e.g., orthodontics for pets)  </li> </ul>  <h2>How Does Nationwide Compare to Other Pet Insurance Providers?</h2>  <h3>Nationwide vs. Healthy Paws</h3>  <ul> <li><strong>Healthy Paws</strong> does <strong>not</strong> cover dental illness unless it’s caused by an accident.  </li> <li><strong>Nationwide</strong> covers dental disease under their Major Medical plan.  </li> </ul>  <h3>Nationwide vs. Trupanion</h3>  <ul> <li><strong>Trupanion</strong> covers dental injuries and diseases but <strong>excludes routine cleanings</strong>.  </li> <li><strong>Nationwide</strong> offers wellness add-ons for preventive care.  </li> </ul>  <h3>Nationwide vs. Embrace</h3>  <ul> <li><strong>Embrace</strong> includes dental illness coverage but requires a separate wellness plan for cleanings.  </li> <li><strong>Nationwide</strong> provides a more bundled approach.  </li> </ul>  <h2>Real-Life Scenarios: When Dental Coverage Saves the Day</h2>  <h3>Case 1: Severe Periodontal Disease</h3>  <p>A 5-year-old Labrador, Max, developed <strong>advanced gum disease</strong> due to lack of cleanings. His owner had Nationwide’s <strong>Major Medical plan</strong>, which covered <strong>$1,200 of his $1,500 extraction surgery</strong>. Without insurance, the bill would’ve been devastating.  </p>  <h3>Case 2: Broken Tooth from Chewing</h3>  <p>A German Shepherd, Luna, cracked a tooth on a hard toy. Nationwide’s policy covered <strong>80% of the $800 extraction</strong> since it was an accidental injury.  </p>  <h3>Case 3: Routine Cleaning Denied</h3>  <p>A cat owner with <strong>only the basic Nationwide plan</strong> was surprised when their claim for a <strong>$400 cleaning</strong> was denied—they hadn’t purchased the wellness add-on.  </p>  <h2>How to Maximize Your Nationwide Dental Coverage</h2>  <ol> <li><strong>Choose the Right Plan</strong> – If dental care is a priority, opt for <strong>Whole Pet with Wellness</strong>.  </li> <li><strong>Start Early</strong> – Enroll your pet <strong>before</strong> dental issues arise to avoid pre-existing condition exclusions.  </li> <li><strong>Regular Checkups</strong> – Catching problems early can prevent costly surgeries later.  </li> <li><strong>Read the Fine Print</strong> – Know what’s covered and what requires additional riders.  </li> </ol>  <h2>The Future of Pet Dental Insurance</h2>  <p>As veterinary medicine advances, <strong>more insurers may expand dental coverage</strong>. With AI-powered diagnostics and telemedicine on the rise, preventive care could become more accessible and affordable.  </p>  <p>For now, Nationwide remains a <strong>strong option</strong> for pet owners who prioritize dental health—but always <strong>compare policies</strong> to find the best fit for your furry friend.  </p>  <p>By understanding your coverage, you can ensure your pet’s smile stays healthy—without breaking the bank.</p>
