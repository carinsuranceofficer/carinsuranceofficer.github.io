                      <p>Divorce is messy—emotionally, financially, and legally. One question that often arises post-divorce is whether you can (or should) name an ex-spouse as a beneficiary on life insurance policies, retirement accounts, or wills. The answer isn’t always straightforward, and it’s further complicated by legal nuances, emotional baggage, and even geopolitical tensions affecting financial systems.  </p>  <h2>The Legal Landscape: What the Courts Say</h2>  <h3>State Laws vs. Federal Regulations</h3>  <p>In the U.S., beneficiary designations are generally governed by state laws, but federal regulations can override them in certain cases—especially with retirement accounts like 401(k)s or IRAs. For example, under ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act), a spouse is automatically the beneficiary of a 401(k) unless they waive that right in writing. If you divorce and forget to update your beneficiary form, your ex could still inherit those funds—even if your will says otherwise.  </p>  <h3>The "Revocation-on-Divorce" Rule</h3>  <p>Many states have adopted the Uniform Probate Code’s "revocation-on-divorce" rule, which automatically removes an ex-spouse as a beneficiary after divorce unless explicitly reinstated. However, this doesn’t apply to all financial instruments. Life insurance policies, for instance, may still pay out to an ex if the policyholder never changed the designation.  </p>  <h2>Why Would Anyone Keep an Ex as a Beneficiary?</h2>  <h3>Co-Parenting and Financial Obligations</h3>  <p>Some divorced couples maintain financial ties, especially if they share children. Naming an ex as a beneficiary on a life insurance policy can ensure that child support or educational expenses are covered if the paying parent dies prematurely.  </p>  <h3>Unfinished Business (or Unresolved Feelings)</h3>  <p>Let’s be honest—not all divorces are acrimonious. Some exes remain close friends or business partners. In high-net-worth divorces, like those of tech moguls or celebrities, ex-spouses might stay beneficiaries as part of complex financial agreements.  </p>  <h2>The Risks of Not Updating Your Beneficiaries</h2>  <h3>The Brittany Murphy Case</h3>  <p>The late actress Brittany Murphy allegedly left her estate to her mother, but because her husband (who died shortly after her) was still listed as a beneficiary on some accounts, legal battles ensued. This highlights how outdated designations can lead to unintended consequences.  </p>  <h3>Geopolitical Factors: Sanctions and Frozen Assets</h3>  <p>In today’s interconnected world, geopolitical conflicts can complicate beneficiary payouts. For example, if an ex-spouse resides in a country under U.S. sanctions (e.g., Russia or Iran), transferring funds to them could violate federal law—even if the divorce decree mandates it.  </p>  <h2>How to Protect Yourself</h2>  <h3>1. Review All Beneficiary Designations Post-Divorce</h3>  <p>Don’t assume a divorce decree automatically updates your will or insurance policies. Check:<br /> - Life insurance<br /> - Retirement accounts (401(k), IRA)<br /> - Bank accounts with payable-on-death clauses<br /> - Trusts  </p>  <h3>2. Consider a Trust for Complex Situations</h3>  <p>If you’re worried about an ex contesting your estate, a trust can provide more control. For example, you could set up a trust for your children with a neutral third-party trustee instead of naming the ex directly.  </p>  <h3>3. Consult a Lawyer—Especially for International Cases</h3>  <p>If your ex lives abroad or holds dual citizenship, tax implications and legal hurdles could arise. A family law attorney with international expertise can help navigate these complexities.  </p>  <h2>The Emotional Side: Is It Ever a Good Idea?</h2>  <h3>When Forgiveness Outweighs Resentment</h3>  <p>For some, keeping an ex as a beneficiary is a gesture of goodwill—especially if the split was amicable. Others do it out of guilt or lingering affection.  </p>  <h3>When It’s a Strategic Move</h3>  <p>In high-conflict divorces, maintaining a financial tie might be a negotiation tactic. For instance, a wealthy entrepreneur might agree to keep an ex as a beneficiary to avoid a messy court battle over other assets.  </p>  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>  <p>Naming an ex-spouse as a beneficiary isn’t inherently wrong, but it’s rarely simple. Legal, financial, and emotional factors all play a role—and in today’s volatile world, even geopolitics can throw a wrench into the best-laid plans. The key takeaway? Always revisit your estate plan after major life changes. Your future self (and your loved ones) will thank you.</p>
